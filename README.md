# Mancala-AI-Bot
A Mancala AI Bot implemented in Python using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for decision making.
Initially created by my colleague Paul Miller.


My contribution is to extend the initial Mancala Ai program to use Monte Carlo algorithm,
Monte carlo simulation.

Files:
    board.py
    mcts.py
    mancala.py

    The mancala.py is the main file that utilizes the Board class and the MCTS class.
    In the main of mancala allows you to run the following:

    - Run a single game of agent using Monte Carlo simulation and an agent that choses moves randomly.

    - Run an analysis of multiple games using multiple number of simulation
        and represents the results in a graph

    - Run a single game of agent using Monte Carlo simulation and an agent using Minimax
        with Alpha-beta pruning

    - Run two agents using Minimax to battle against each other




System requirements
    Using terminal with python 2.7
    Python libraries used: numpy, matplotlib, random, multiprocessing, and math
    There were no open source code used in the development for Monte carlo simulation.

How to run:

    python mancala.py

    This will prompt you options:
        “1 : Monte Carlo Ai vs Random player"
        "2 : Monte Carlo Ai analysis"
        "3 : Monte Carlo Ai vs Minimax with pruning"
        "4 : Minimax Ai vs Minimax Ai"

        Enter choice ->

        Enter 1-4 to run different functions and watch games or analysis unfold.
